#################################### TASK CONDITION ############################
12.	* Christmas Spirit
It is time to get in a Christmas mood. You need to decorate the house in time for
the big event, but you have limited days to do so.
Write a program that calculates how much money you will need to spend on 
Christmas decorations and how much your Christmas spirit will improve.
On the first line, you will receive the quantity of decorations you should buy each time you go shopping. 
On the second line, you will receive the days left until Christmas. 
There are 4 types of decorations, and each piece costs a certain price. 
Also, each time you go shopping for a concrete type of decoration, your Christmas spirit is improved by some points:
Decoration	Price/Piece	Points/Shopping
Ornament Set	2$	5
Tree Skirt	5$	3
Tree Garland	3$	10
Tree Lights	15$	17
Until Christmas, you go shopping for a certain decoration as follows:
•	Every second day you buy Ornament Sets.
•	Every third day you buy Tree Skirts and Tree Garlands.
•	Every fifth day you buy Tree Lights. 
o	If you have bought Tree Skirts and Tree Garlands on the same day, you 
additionally increase your spirit by 30.
That's not all! You have a cat at home that really likes to mess around with the decoration:
•	Every tenth day your cat ruins all tree decorations, and you lose 20 points of the spirit:
o	Because of that, you go shopping (for a second time during the day) to buy
one piece of tree skirt, garlands, and lights, but you do NOT earn additional spirit points for them.
•	Also, because of the cat - at the beginning of every eleventh day, you are
forced to increase the quantity of decorations needed to be bought each time you go shopping by 2.
•	If the last day is a tenth day, the cat demolishes even more and ruins
the Christmas turkey, and you lose an additional 30 points of spirit.
In the end, you must print the total cost and the gained spirit.
Input / Constraints
The input will consist of exactly 2 lines:
•	quantity - integer in the range [1…100]
•	days - integer in the range [1…100]
Output
In the end, print the total cost and the total gained spirit in the following format:
•	"Total cost: {budget}"
•	"Total spirit: {totalSpirit}"
